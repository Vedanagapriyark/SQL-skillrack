create table car (id INT, name VARCHAR(100), topspeed INT); 
Write the SQL query to select name and topspeed from the table car where topspeed value is any one of these values - 190, 408, 220 and 349. 
Note: The order of the columns in the result set must be name, topspeed. 
The result set must be ordered by the column value topspeed in descending order.

FROM car
WHERE topspeed IN (190, 408, 220, 349)
ORDER BY topspeed DESC;
